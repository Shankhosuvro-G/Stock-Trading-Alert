I've developed a Python application that autonomously dispatches notifications to a verified contact number whenever the variance between the closing prices of consecutive days surpasses a predefined threshold. This project heavily leverages APIs and their respective documentation. The APIs incorporated in this project include:

1. Stock Price API
2. News API
3. Twilio API

These APIs collectively enable the program to monitor stock prices, gather news, and send out alerts effectively. This automation serves as a reliable tool for keeping track of significant market fluctuations.
For automation i have uploaded this into Python anywhere cloud.
